This is the 2nd assignment of the ML course - Random Optimization

I have used the library "mlrose-hiive" which is a modified version created by Andrew Rollings and Genevieve Hayes' fork of mlrose.


Please write the following in python terminal before proceeding to run the code:

pip install -e git+git://github.com/hiive/mlrose#egg=mlrose-hiive



My github repository containing the codes:
https://github.com/AdiBhushan10/Machine-Learning-OMS---RandomOptimization-

This repository contains two python files:
a) NeuralNetworkWithCurves_Assignment2.py
This is one part of the Assignment 2 where i used optimization techniques to find best weights for my neural netowrk designed in assignment 1
I used ExoPlanet Identification Dataset that can be found in the "Data" folder on the same repository.

b) RandomOptimization.py
This is the other part of Assignment 2 where I wrote the code to perform Genetic Algorithm, Stimulated Annealing, Random Hill Climbing (with Restarts) and MIMIC agorithms
on three Optimization Problems - FourPeaks, ContinuousPeaks and Flip Flop.

You can directly run these files after installing mlrose_hiive as instructed in the beginning.
